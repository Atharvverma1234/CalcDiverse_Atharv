# <p align="center">Singular Value Decomposition Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The SVD Calculator simplifies the process of performing Singular Value Decomposition, which is widely used in numerical analysis, machine learning, and data science. Given a square matrix, the tool decomposes it into:

𝑈 : An orthogonal matrix containing the left singular vectors.
𝑆 : A diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
𝑉 : An orthogonal matrix containing the right singular vectors.
